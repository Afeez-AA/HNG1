# User and Group Management Script

This Bash script automates user and group management on a Linux system. It reads usernames and associated groups from a file, creates users with random passwords, assigns them to groups, and logs all actions.

## Overview

- **Functionality**: Creates users, sets up home directories, assigns users to specified groups, generates random passwords, and logs actions.
- **Logging**: Logs all actions to `/var/log/user_management.log`.
- **Password Storage**: Stores generated passwords securely in `/var/secure/user_passwords.txt`.
- **Detailed Information**: For detailed explanation of each step and how to run the script, please refer to the [blog post](https://dev.to/afeezaa/automating-user-and-group-management-with-a-bash-script-59je).
